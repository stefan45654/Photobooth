# Photobooth
Photobooth for the Raspberry Pi
This project represents a "Photobooth" for the Raspberry Pi (tested on RPi 2) which uses a webserver and any tablet as a display. The software generates a collage out of 4 images which can then be printed directly on a Canon CP910 dye sublimation printer (or any other airprint printer). As the camera every camera supported by the gphoto2 project can be used.
